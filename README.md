A simple yet effective Pomodoro Timer application built with Python and Tkinter. This GUI helps you implement the Pomodoro Technique - a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Features
ÔøΩ Customizable Timer: Standard 25-minute work sessions with 5-minute short breaks and 15-minute long breaks

üîÑ Auto-cycling: Automatically switches between work and break sessions

üîî Visual & Audio Alerts: Notifications when a session ends

üìä Session Tracking: Keeps count of completed Pomodoro sessions

üé® Clean Interface: Minimalist design with intuitive controls

‚èØÔ∏è Pause/Resume: Ability to pause the timer when needed

Requirements
Python 3.x

Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

(Optional) playsound library for audio notifications

Installation
Clone this repository or download the source code

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pomodoro-timer.git
Navigate to the project directory

cd pomodoro-timer
Run the application

python pomodoro_timer.py
Usage
Launch the application

Click "Start" to begin your Pomodoro session

Work focused for 25 minutes until the timer rings

Take a 5-minute break when the timer ends

After 4 work sessions, take a longer 15-minute break

Use "Reset" to restart the current session or "Pause" to temporarily stop the timer

Customization
You can easily modify the timer durations by editing these constants in the code:

python
WORK_MIN = 25         # Duration of work sessions in minutes
SHORT_BREAK_MIN = 5   # Duration of short breaks in minutes
LONG_BREAK_MIN = 15   # Duration of long breaks in minutes
